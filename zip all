To create individual **`.zip` files for each directory** in the current folder, you can use this command:

### **Command:**
```bash
for dir in */; do zip -r "${dir%/}.zip" "$dir"; done
```

### **Explanation:**
1. **`for dir in */; do`**  
   - Loops through all directories (`*/` matches only folders).

2. **`"${dir%/}"`**  
   - Removes the trailing `/` from the directory name (e.g., `L1/` â†’ `L1`).

3. **`zip -r "${dir%/}.zip" "$dir"`**  
   - Creates a `.zip` file with the same name as the directory (`-r` for recursive compression).

### **Alternative (Excluding `.gif` Files):**
If you want to **skip non-directory files** (like `.gif` files), use:
```bash
for dir in */; do zip -r "${dir%/}.zip" "$dir"; done
```
This safely ignores files since `*/` only matches directories.

### **Bonus: One-Liner Version**
```bash
for d in */; do zip -r "${d%/}.zip" "$d"; done
```
