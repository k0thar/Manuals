# Recovering Deleted Home Folders in Void Linux

## Immediate Actions

1. **Stop using the system immediately** - Continued use reduces chances of recovery as deleted files may be overwritten.

2. **Boot from a live USB** - Don't boot into your normal system to prevent overwriting deleted files.

## Data Recovery Options

### Using TestDisk/PhotoRec
1. Boot from a live USB
2. Install recovery tools:
   ```
   xbps-install -S testdisk
   ```
3. Run TestDisk to attempt partition/file recovery:
   ```
   sudo testdisk
   ```

### Using extundelete (if you used ext4)
```
xbps-install -S extundelete
sudo extundelete /dev/sdXY --restore-directory /home/<username>
```

## Restoring User Account

If your user account seems missing:

1. Check if the user still exists:
   ```
   grep yourusername /etc/passwd
   ```

2. If missing, recreate it:
   ```
   sudo useradd -m -G wheel,audio,video,storage yourusername
   sudo passwd yourusername
   ```
## There may be a need for reboot for system to actualy add user into new group
## Preventing Future Issues

1. Set up regular backups (rsync, borg, etc.)
2. Consider using snapshots with Btrfs or ZFS
3. Be extra careful with `rm -rf` commands

## If Recovery Fails

You may need to:
1. Reinstall applications
2. Restore from backups if available
3. Reconfigure your system settings
