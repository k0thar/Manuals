It looks like you're having several issues with your Git setup. Let me help you fix them step by step:

### 1. First, you need to set your Git identity (this is required for commits):
```bash
git config --global user.email "your_email@example.com"
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
```

### 2. Then, you need to actually create a commit. Your first attempt failed because of the identity issue:
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "1st try"
```

### 3. Now, about the branch issue - it seems you don't have any branches yet. Let's check:
```bash
git branch
```

If there are no branches shown, you need to create one:
```bash
git checkout -b main
```

### 4. Now you can push to your remote repository:
```bash
git push -u origin main
```
